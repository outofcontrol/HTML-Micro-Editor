### How to use
Clone this repository to your local machine, and host the page with [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/valet) or your favourite local server software. You may now copy-paste from Word or Google and have fairly clean HTML. Great to quickly post a blog or press release for your clients that use Google Docs or Word. 

### Contributions
Improvements and fixes welcome as long as it remains a single file and allows copy paste from Google or Word.
